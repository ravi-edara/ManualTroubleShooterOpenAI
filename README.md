I've been exploring a fresh approach to the task, tapping into Azure AI OpenAI's LLM to engage in conversations with PDF documents.

The goal is to evolve the system gradually, refining it iteratively based on user interactions and feedback to 
provide more accurate answers over time. Starting with a basic chat interface and integrating 
Azure AI OpenAI's LLM lays the foundation for a more sophisticated system. 

As the system evolves and the Azure LLM learns from interactions, 
we'll revisit and optimize the implementation as needed. Detailed explanations 
of these approaches are also available in a video format.
